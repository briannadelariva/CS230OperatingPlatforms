Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room, the client, asked for the creation of the web-based game "Draw It or Lose It." In this game, teams must predict the drawings made by players within a set amount of time. Players draw pictures from a collection to use as hints. With support for numerous teams, unique team and game names, and a strong backend for managing players, teams, and game instances, the client requested an online version of their current Android app.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The "Draw It or Lose It" game's specifications, design limitations, and system architecture are all clearly laid out in the documentation. It also offers a complete analysis of the requirements for development across several platforms, providing a thorough grasp of the benefits and drawbacks. The document also contains well-thought-out suggestions derived from the assessment.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The development process is outlined in the design paper. It provided a clear grasp of the architecture of the system, important needs, and design restrictions, which assisted with code structuring. A well-documented plan allowed team members to collaborate more easily and provided a point of reference for the duration of the development process.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The "Evaluation" section might be one area to go over again. Although the pros and cons unique to the platform are covered, this section might benefit from a more thorough examination that addresses issues like user experience and implementation difficulties. It would also be more precise to include the version numbers of the frameworks and technologies that were taken into consideration throughout the study.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client's desire for an online version of their current software with features like team support, unique names, and an easy-to-use UI helped to interpret user needs. The goal of the design was to give players a straightforward but interesting experience. User demands must be taken into account in order to guarantee that the finished program meets end users' expectations and preferences, which will result in a more successful and fulfilling product.



How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The methodology comprised defining essential needs, comprehending design limitations, and developing a modular system architecture. I would continue to place a high value on open communication with stakeholders, carry out in-depth requirements research, and use iterative design methods in order to study and create apps that are similar in the future. Additionally, more efficient and flexible software designs would result from include user feedback at every stage of the development process and keeping up with new technological developments.
